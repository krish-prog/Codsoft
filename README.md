Codsoft Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for my internship projects at Codsoft. This repository contains five machine learning projects that showcase various techniques and applications. Below is an overview of each project along with instructions for setup and usage.
Projects
1. Titanic Survival Prediction

    Description: Predicts the survival of Titanic passengers based on features like age, gender, and class.
    Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and performance evaluation.
